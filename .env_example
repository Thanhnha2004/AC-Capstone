# Notes:
# - For local hardhat network, accounts are auto-generated

# - USER1_PRIVATE_KEY is optional - used only if you want a specific user1 on testnet
# - Keep your .env file in .gitignore!

# Example account structure on different networks:
# 
# Hardhat Network (local):
#   - deployer: Account #0 (auto-generated)
#   - operator: Account #0 (same as deployer)
#   - feeReceiver: Account #0 (same as deployer)
#   - user1: Account #1 (auto-generated)
#   - user2: Account #2 (auto-generated)
#   - ... up to Account #9 (10 accounts total)
#
# Sepolia Testnet:
#   - deployer: Uses TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY
#   - operator: Same as deployer
#   - feeReceiver: Same as deployer
#   - user1: Uses USER1_PRIVATE_KEY (if provided), else falls back to deployer
#   - user2: Falls back to deployer
